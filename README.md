# 🎃 Spooky Map

**Spooky Map** is a web-based application designed to help Halloween participants and trick-or-treaters connect in a fun and safe way. It allows users to pin their decorated houses on a shared map, view other participants, plan optimized trick-or-treat routes, and even access safety information such as sex offender records.

## 📌 Project Overview

Many neighborhoods struggle to coordinate Halloween participation. Spooky Map provides an interactive and community-driven solution to:

- Register participating homes
- View and filter Halloween activity on a map
- Optimize trick-or-treat routes
- Promote safety with public record links and reporting tools

### 🛡️ 3. Safety Feature

  Using the same location-based pinning and route optimization features, the platform can help organize and promote various small-to-medium-sized local events throughout the year.
